# Welcome to RoboCollector

This is my first bigger game project using Unity, Blender and GitHub.

## Description

The game features a robot collecting items and avoid obstacles. They start off with five lives, but if they touch an obstacle, they will lose one. Each level ends when the player either collects all of the items, runs out of time or loses all of their lives. The player will likely have a slightly faster movement speed than the obstacles, so that the player can escape, as it may be demotivating for the players if they cannot escape the obstacles. In addition, if the items move, the player will likely have a slightly faster movement speed than them so that they can collect them easier, as it may also be demotivating for the player if they cannot catch up with the butterflies.

## Getting Started
